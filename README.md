## Queue system

Simple queue system for creating tickets and processing them on server-side. Users can submit their ticket that will be enqueued to least full station. After some time user will recieve notification when their ticket is completed.

### Tech-stack

- Adonis.js 5 (Node.js framework)
- Redis as database
- Websocket for real-time notification

### Setup (Dev server only)

__Environment:__

Create `.env` file according to `.env.example` template inside root of project.

__Install required dependencies:__

```bash
# Install project dependencies
npm install

# Install Adonis as global package (REQUIRED)
npm install adonis -g
```

__Start dev server:__
```bash
npm run dev
```

__Start worker:__

```bash
adonis work
```

### Potential improvements

- Automatically open/close station instances based on user needs
- Implement transactions for safe data manipulation
